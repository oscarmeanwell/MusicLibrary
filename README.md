# MusicLibrary
Requirements
  - Python 3
  - pyglet 1.2.4

An application for playing music with an incoperated library. (beta)
Simply place in a directory with music files or directories containing music.
Sorry, this project was abandoned due to a lack of pyglet development, (I was using a python 2 version, the development one for python 3 is very buggy - no good alternative for playing audio. (I hate pygame))
